# Nightmare Binary Exploitation / Reverse Engineering Course

The following write-ups are based on the notes [Nightmare](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/). Most of the files can be found on [guyinatuxedo's GitHub Repo](https://github.com/guyinatuxedo/nightmare). If they are created by others, I will also include their names and sources.

I will try to break down the process of exploring the challenges to better understand the exploitation and techniques. 

> Hope you enjoy your stay :)
