    > `rain` believed that writing clickbait article titles would boost views.
    > 
    > 
    > They then became engrossed in creating and spreading disinformation.
    > 
    > In their very first fake article, an unrelated caption was attached to an image. Find the original source and answer which municipality's materials this image appeared in.
    > 
    > You do not need to include the prefecture name.
    > 
    > For example, if the picture were on the document about `平塚市` (Hiratsuka City), the flag would be `SWIMMER{平塚市}`.

It should be 工事中 濾過池(其一), as is ancient Japanese/Chinese, people tend to write from right to left, that’s why I feel a bit weird the first time I read this

</aside>

Searching it will find the result(I need to omit OSINT because there are way too many write-ups out there)
