- Description
    
    We want to know `debeyohiru`'s real name.
    
    Answer the name you believe is their legal name.
    
    For example, if their real name were `Sanae Takaichi`, the flag would be `SWIMMER{Sanae Takaichi}`.
    
    Please answer in Latin alphabet; you do not need to consider Kanji or Hiragana.
    

The most possible place for us to discover his real name might be his [personal profile](https://furaigo5.github.io/profile/)
