# CTF stuff

My pile of CTF writeups, notes, and scripts.  
Mostly for myself, but feel free to dig around.

## What’s inside

This repo stores my CTF writeups and scripts,  
both for practice (HTB/THM/pico) and live CTF (RUSEC, PerfectRoot, etc.).

## Why this exists

- Remember how challenges were solved
- Reuse scripts and techniques later
- Track progress without relying on memory

## Note
Flags and infra belong to their original platforms.  
I write these write-ups only for learning purposes.
